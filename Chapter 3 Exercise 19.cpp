// Chapter 3 Exercise 19.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.

// Requirrements:Monthly Payments
//The monthly payment on a loan may be calculated by the following formula :
//Payment = Rate × (1 + Rate)N((1 + Rate)N−1)
//Rate is the monthly interest rate, which is the annual interest rate divided by 12. (12 percent annual interest would be 1 percent monthly interest.) N is the number of payments, and L is the amount of the loan.Write a program that asks for these values then displays a report similar to :

//Loan Amount : $ 10000.00
//Monthly Interest Rate : 1 %
//Number of Payments : 36
//Monthly Payment : $   332.14
//Amount Paid Back : $ 11957.15
//Interest Paid : $  1957.15
